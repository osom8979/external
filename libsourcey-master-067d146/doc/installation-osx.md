Install CMake
 : CMake generates the LibSourcey project files so you can build on most platforms and compilers. [Download CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)

Install OpenSSL
 : If you don't already have OpenSSL development headers on your Mac, then please follow [this guide](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/OpenSSL/OpenSSL-7.1/openssl/INSTALL?txt) to install them.

Download LibSourcey
 : Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sourcey/libsourcey.git`.
   If you haven't got Git for some reason you can download and extract the [package archive](https://github.com/sourcey/libsourcey) from Github. -->

<!-- ## Generate Project Files

See linux instructions. -->

<!-- Open the CMake GUI and set the project directory to point to the LibSourcey root directory. Execute "Configure" to do the initial configuration, then adjust any options, then press "Configure" again and then press "Generate". -->

<!-- [See here](/installation.md#cmake-build-options) for a complete list of build options. -->

## Compile with Xcode
